# ClickTrans Registration Form test

The goal for this task was to provide manual testing of registration form https://dev-1.clicktrans.pl/register-test/courier and report all notices and bugs from my point of view in a format I think it should be.
This is what the mockup registration form looks like:

So I started an exploratory session of a given website to find some interesting test cases. I divided them into two categories: Correct registration (how to register correctly) and Registration form (all the potential issues) Here is a list of them:
